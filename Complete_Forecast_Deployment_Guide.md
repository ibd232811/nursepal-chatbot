### **Sales Team Forecasts**
```
Query: "Should I lock in ICU rates now or wait 6 months?"

• Plan 4-6% pay increases for Q2 to maintain 60th percentile
• Accelerate hiring NOW while rates are still competitive
• Competition for talent will increase significantly"
```

### **Finance Team Forecasts**

Query: "Budget impact of rate trends for 2025?"
